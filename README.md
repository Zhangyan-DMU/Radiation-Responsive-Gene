To accurately identify radiation-responsive genes, we constructed some LET-regression models based on genetic algorithms (GA). 
In simple terms, we used GA to select the optimal combination of genes, enabling the LET-regression model to achieve the best performance. Clearly, the genes selected by the GA are the radiation-responsive genes.
The four CSV files are datasets used for modeling.
